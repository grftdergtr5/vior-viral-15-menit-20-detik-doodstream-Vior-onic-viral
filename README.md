Vior, whose full name is Viorenita Sutanto, is a prominent figure in the Indonesian esports scene, particularly known for her association with ONIC Esports. Born on July 26, 1999, in Jakarta, she is of Indonesian and South Korean descent. Her journey into esports began with her active presence on TikTok, where she amassed a significant following by sharing dance videos and gaming content. This popularity led to her recruitment as a brand ambassador for ONIC Esports. 

In addition to her role as a brand ambassador, Vior made history by becoming the only female player in the Mobile Legends Professional League (MPL) Indonesia Season 9, playing as a Mid-Laner for ONIC Esports.  Her participation marked her as the second woman to compete in the MPL ID, following Listy Chan. 

Beyond her esports career, Vior is also recognized for her streaming activities on platforms like Nimo TV, where she has garnered a substantial audience. Her engaging content and gaming skills have solidified her status as a notable figure in the gaming community. 

In November 2024, Vior became the subject of controversy due to the unauthorized circulation of a personal video. Reports indicate that the video, lasting approximately 15 minutes and 20 seconds, was shared without her consent, raising significant concerns about digital privacy and media ethics.  The incident has sparked discussions about the importance of consent and the ethical responsibilities of individuals and platforms in the digital age. 

Despite this challenging episode, Vior continues to be a respected and influential figure in the esports and streaming communities, admired for her talent, dedication, and contributions to the industry.
